            I wish I could say that I'm a born computer geek, but alas, that is not me. I'm an artist and a writer at heart. Unfortunately, while art and writing are food for the soul, they do little to feed the bank account. And so I have recently moved into the 21st century and studied graphic design and web development. In the end I see these for practices as the same. I'm building and creating and that is what I love to do most.
